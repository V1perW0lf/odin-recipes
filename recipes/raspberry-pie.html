    <h2>Description</h2>

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 recipe Perfect Pastry (or enough pastry for one double crust)</li>
        <li>5 cups raspberries (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>pinch nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, gently toss together the raspberries, sugar, flour, lemon juice and nutmeg. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Roll out half of the pastry and fit it inside a 9 inch pie plate, trimming off the excess pastry.</li>
        <li>Place the raspberry mixture inside the pie crust.</li>
        <li>Lightly wet the edge of the crust with a bit of water.</li>
        <li>Roll out the other half of the pastry and set it over top of the berries, or cut it into one inch strips and weave the strips into a lattice top over the berries.</li>
        <li>Crimp the edges to seal them. If you are using a full crust, cut slits in the top to vent the pie.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the egg and water and brush it lightly over top of the pastry.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with a bit of extra sugar.</li>
        <li>Place the pie on a baking sheet in case it bubbles over.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes, then REDUCE THE HEAT to 375 degrees F and continue baking for another 35-40 minutes or until the crust is lightly browned and the filling is bubbling.</li>
        <li>If the pastry is getting too brown and the filling isn't bubbling yet, tent some foil over top to prevent more browning.</li>
        <li>Allow the pie to cool completely before slicing so that the filling will firm up.</li>
    </ol>
